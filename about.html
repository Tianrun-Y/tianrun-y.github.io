                I graduated from the University of St Andrews in 2024 with a master's degree in mathematics. I took modules covering a wide range of disciplines within mathematics as part of my degree, and my passion was particularly in pure mathematics.

                I completed my final year project under the guidance of Dr. Collin Bleak, on Mikhail Gromov's Hyperbolic Groups and the proofs of the two theorems. It was my first time researching and writing maths myself. Admittedly, the theorems were proposed and already proven by Gromov himself, but the challenge of the project was to fit the proofs into a self-contained paper, building up the theorems and lemmas, assuming the reader only has basic knowledge in group theory. So, I had to gather proof ideas from various sources, and even write original proofs to some of the lemmas myself! It was a challenge, certainly, but also great fun and learning experience.
