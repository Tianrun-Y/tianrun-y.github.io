            <p>
                I graduated from the University of St Andrews in 2024 with a master's degree in mathematics. I took modules covering a wide range of disciplines within mathematics as part of my degree, and I had a passion in particular for abstract algebra and mathematical logic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed my final year project under the guidance of Dr. Collin Bleak, on Mikhail Gromov's Hyperbolic Groups and the proofs of two theorems. It was my first time researching and writing maths myself. To put everything in a self-contained paper, I gathered proof ideas from various sources, and even wrote original proofs to some of the lemmas myself! It was a challenge, certainly, but also great fun and a learning experience.  
            </p>

                In summer 2024, I did an internship project with Prof James Mitchell at the University of St Andrews, to contribute to a mathematical software called GAP, which has helped researchers for several decades since its creation. It was my first time being part of a large project, and I gained valuable experience in using git and GitHub as part of the workflow. As my main contribution in this project, I saw the whole transition from mathematical theorems in research papers to new implications of several software features that improved the time performance significantly. This experience greatly inspired me to learn more about programming!
            </p>

            <p>
                I then moved to London to prepare for my next chapter of life. I’ve been working as a team member at a high-end cafe in Chelsea, gaining valuable experiences at interacting with people in a high-demanding professional setting. For someone of a typical STEM background, this experience has provided me with great insights into the art of communication and great opportunities to brush up on my own skills. At the same time, I’ve started a journey of teaching myself programming, and saw a gradual transition from learning things to making things, from doing Leetcode challenges to building actual projects. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I derive great joy from learning, no doubt, but what also powers me through is my passion for reading, writing (in both English and Chinese), and especially mountaineering. I am an avid hillwalker, and had the privilege to participate in this hobby of bagging the Munros of Scotland, having finished 62 of them in all kinds of conditions imaginable! Because I am in London now, I can’t go to the mountains as often as I used to, but I stay an active rock climber who goes on climbing adventures regularly. These mountain and climbing adventures taught me the power of resilience, the understanding of risks and how to manage them, and gave me memories and friendships that I shall cherish forever. 
            </p>

            <p>
                From all my experiences, I believe deeply in the power of humility, and I embrace the opportunities to learn, to improve, and to be inspired by all the great people I have met and will meet in the future. If you’ve read it this far, firstly, thank you, and please be assured that I will be a valuable member and contributor to your team, to your project, and to the goals you want to achieve. I am very excited for the new opportunities ahead!
